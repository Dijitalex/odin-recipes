    <p><em>This is Mushroom Risotto, not to be confused with "Mushroom Risotto."</em></p>
    <p>Ah yes, mushroom risotto. An old classic of Italy (I think). Mushroom Risotto is a dish known to have originated from the great man known as Otto, known for having exceptional "rizz." Thus the name risotto!
        This is a dish that is delicious and easy to master, so long as you have two working arms. Let's get started with how to make it!
