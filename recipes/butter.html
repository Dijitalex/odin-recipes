    <p><em>As seen above is a stick of butter.</em></p>
    <p>Butter is a staple in many cuisines across the globe. In fact there are even some communities out there that worship butter as if it were some deity. Here you will learn
        what steps are needed in order to assimilate among your butter-enthusiast neighbors.

    <p><h2>Ingredients:</h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Particle Accelerator</li>
        <li>Protons</li>
        <li>Neutrons (optional)</li>
        <li>Electrons</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h2>Steps:</h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Turn on the particle accelerator and feed into it your particles (p, e, and n)</li>
        <li>Constantly fire these particles at preexisting compounds that are present in Earth's atmosphere.</li>
        <li>By quantum mechanics, eventually these particles will manifest and fuse in a way that will result in the creation of a molecule that is commonly referred to as "butter" by the homo sapien species</li>
        <li>Neutrons are not required but are heavily recommended in order to prevent this molecule of butter from decaying into a different compound in infinitesimal time.</li>
        <li>Serve with bread, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
