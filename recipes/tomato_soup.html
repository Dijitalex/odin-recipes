    <p><em>A classic dish to be enjoyed when you're on a tight budget, or you're just feeling like you want something more on the acidic side.</em></p>
    <p>Fun fact tomatoes came from the Americas, and there were initially thought to have been very poisonous. It wasn't until some madman by the name of Tom A. Teaux wanted to commit suicide by eating it, but instead found it to be rather delicious.
        Tom was then inspired to make all sorts of dishes based on this fruit (not a vegetable!), and among them, tomato soup is one of his creations, and one of my personasl favorite foods.

    <p><h2>Ingredients:</h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Scallions</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Chicken Stock (sorry vegetarians)</li>

    </ul>
    <p><h2>Steps:</h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the cut tomatoes into a hot-oiled pot and constantly stir them around while also mashing them to get their juices out.</li>
        <li>After having done this for a while, put in the stock along with the salt.</li>
        <li>Put the lid on the pot and wait for the <strong>substance</strong> to boil.</li>
        <li>Once this is done, you can now add in the pepper and the cut scallions. (We do this now and not earlier because otherwise they would sink to the bottom of the soup)</li>
        <li>Serve with bread, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
